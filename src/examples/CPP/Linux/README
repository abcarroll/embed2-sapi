To build you need:
- compiled boost library: boost::thread (www.boost.org)
- compiled php embed2 sapi

since boost names it's libraries using it's version number and used compiler 
you probably have to change the makefile to your libboost_thread???? library.

You probably only need to alter the BOOST_COMPILER var 

This one is set to gcc40 to link to libboost_thread_gcc40-mt
